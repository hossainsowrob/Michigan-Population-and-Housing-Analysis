 Project Overview:
This project analyzes five years of county-level population and housing data (2020–2024) across Michigan.
The goal is to understand how housing growth compares to population expansion in different regions of the state.

 Process
	•	Combined population and housing datasets using Power Query for efficient data merging.
	•	Applied Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX, MAX) to clean, calculate, and compare year-over-year growth rates.
	•	Built an interactive Excel dashboard using Pivot Tables, slicers, and charts to visualize population vs. housing trends.

 Key Insights
	•	Population across key Michigan counties grew by 49% cumulatively (2020–2024), while housing expanded by only 16%.
	•	Counties such as Lake and Montmorency showed the highest population growth but slower housing development, indicating potential housing pressure.
	•	The correlation chart reveals that population growth generally outpaced housing availability across high-growth regions.

Conclusion:
This analysis highlights a widening gap between Michigan’s population increase and available housing supply, emphasizing the need for proactive housing policy planning in rapidly growing counties.
